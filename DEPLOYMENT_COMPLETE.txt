CONFIGURATION DETAILS
================================================================================

GitHub Repository:
  URL: https://github.com/Alfastudios/plex-random-picker
  Owner: Alfastudios
  Branch: main

Environment Variables (Pre-configured):
  VITE_PLEX_URL = http://192.168.1.88:32400
  VITE_PLEX_TOKEN = o-CQNS6jTNt-3uihuSey
  JWT_SECRET = tu-super-secreto-cambiar-en-produccion

Build Process:
  Install: npm install && cd client && npm install
  Build: npm run build
  Start: npm start

================================================================================
HOW TO DEPLOY
================================================================================

OPTION 1: AUTOMATED (Recommended)
----------------------------------
Step 1: Get Railway API token from https://railway.app/account/tokens
Step 2: Run the deployment script:

  export RAILWAY_TOKEN='your-token-here'
  cd /Users/alfastudios/plex-random-picker
  ./railway-deploy.sh

Step 3: Access the deployment URL provided by the script

OPTION 2: MANUAL
----------------
Step 1: Visit https://railway.app/new
Step 2: Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
Step 3: Select Alfastudios/plex-random-picker
Step 4: Add environment variables manually
Step 5: Deploy and access your app

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. RAILWAY API TOKEN REQUIRED
   - GitHub credentials cannot be used directly with Railway
   - Railway requires its own API token for automation
   - Token must be obtained from Railway dashboard
   - This is a security requirement from Railway

2. GITHUB OAUTH INTEGRATION
   - Railway connects to GitHub via OAuth
   - First-time setup requires manual GitHub authorization
   - This is a one-time setup through Railway's web interface

3. DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE
   - Script execution: 30-60 seconds
   - Initial deployment: 3-5 minutes
   - Total time to live URL: ~5-6 minutes

4. SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Change JWT_SECRET after deployment
   - Never commit Railway token to git
   - Use environment variables for all secrets
   - Review Railway access permissions

================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS DURING DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

1. Authentication: Verifies Railway API token
2. Project Creation: Creates new Railway project
3. Repository Connection: Links to GitHub repo
4. Environment Setup: Configures env variables
5. Service Creation: Sets up the application service
6. Build Trigger: Starts the build process
7. Deployment: Deploys to Railway infrastructure
8. Domain Assignment: Provides .up.railway.app URL

================================================================================
POST-DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

You will receive:
  - Project ID (unique identifier)
  - Service ID (service identifier)
  - Environment ID (environment identifier)
  - Dashboard URL (management interface)
  - Deployment URL (live application URL)

Next steps:
  1. Visit deployment URL to verify
  2. Test Plex integration
  3. Update JWT_SECRET to secure value
  4. Set up custom domain (optional)
  5. Configure CI/CD for auto-deployments
